"""
This script demonstrates how a building can be generated by importing building
data from excel.
An appropriate example file with some building data is imported from
examplefiles/ExcelBuildingData_Sample.xlsx.

In the excel every room is listed by its own, via a custom defined zoning
algorithm these rooms are combined to zones.
The user needs to adjust the zoning to his needs.
See # Block: Zoning methodologies (define your zoning function here)

Limitations and assumptions:
- Outer and inner wall area depend on the calculations done in the excel
- Ground floor area is only as big the respective net area of the heated room
volume (NetArea)
- Floor area is only as big the respective net area of the heated room volume
(NetArea)
- Rooftop area is only as big the respective net area of the heated room
volume (NetArea)
- Rooftops are flat and not tilted, see "RooftopTilt"
- Ceiling area is only as big the respective net area of the heated room
volume (NetArea)
- Ceiling, floor and inner walls are only respected by half their area,
since they belong half to the respective
and half to the adjacent zone
- Orientations are clockwise in degree, 0° is directed north

-respective construction types have to be added to the TypeBuildingElements.json
-respective UsageTypes for Zones have to be added to the UseConditions.json
-excel file format has to be as shown in the "ExcelBuildingData_Sample.xlsx"

Information about the required excel format:
#Documentation in progress!
-yellowed columns are necessary input to teaser -> don´t change column
header, keep value names consistent.
-non yellowed columns may either not be used or be used for your zoning
algorithm
-Under the cell ‚Usage type‘  you will see some cells that are blank but have
their row filled.
It means the blank cell actually belongs to the Usage type above but in that
specific row we filled the characteristics
of the window/wall of a different orientation of the same exact room. That
means every row is either a new room or a
new orientation of that room. A room might have two outer walls in two
different orientation so for each outer wall,
a an extra row defining the respective orientation is added
-The entries in the excel sheet must be consistent for python being able to
convert it.
-If an inner wall is reaching inside a room but is not the limit of the room,
it should be accounted with 2x the area
